# Pokemon Go Mini-Map

##Get Started

1. Either go to the github pages [site](https://robertlemonds.github.io/udacity-pokestopmap/) or download repository. **(UPDATE!! YELP API has issues loading in Github pages, so to view this project correctly please download the zip to view complete work!)**
	
	*If the app is downloaded via Github onto your local machine, navigate to the index.html file and open in your browser.

2. Once you are on the site or the repository is downloaded you can begin using the Pokemon Go Mini-Map by typing in the search bar (either exact keyword or by pokestop/gym).

3. Alternatively you can click the locations on the list and an animation for the marker will start bounce to show where it is on the map.

4. Clicking a Marker on the map will pull data from Yelps API giving you a review of the local business there if you want to enjoy yourself while you are out and about.

5. When an infowindow is opened via clicking or tapping (mobile) the link will take you to the Yelp page where you can find more information.
